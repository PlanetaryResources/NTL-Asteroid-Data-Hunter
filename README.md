NASA'S ASTEROID DATA HUNTER APP

ABOUT THE APP
Using the latest developments in machine learning algorithms, we have developed an algorithm that is capable of utilizing imagery data from modern telescopes to find more asteroids than has previously ever been possible. This new method is approximately 15% better than the current method of identifying asteroids in the main belt (Asteroids that orbit between Mars & Jupiter). The algorithm is capable of running on a common laptop/desktop. Algorithms like these will be used on future spacecraft to identify asteroids to maximize the capability of missions in the future.The application contains a user interface that anyone can use without too much of a learning curve for new users. It’s also easy to install and comes with a one-click installation process (no configuration necessary!). For the expert user, full documentation and source code are available for modifications and tweaking.


DOWNLOAD THE APP
The app is currently available for download for Windows (7.1+), Mac (10.10.X+) & Linux (Ubuntu) users. To download the app installers, please visit: http://www.topcoder.com/asteroids/asteroiddatahunter/


WHO SHOULD DOWNLOAD THE APP?
Currently, the app is targeted towards hobbyist and amateur astronomers who have their own telescopes.


DOES THE APP INCLUDE SAMPLE IMAGES TO SEARCH AGAINST?
The app does not come pre-bundled with test images, or the ability to download sample images – if you have access to a telescope and can take photos of the sky, you can upload these photos as long as they are in .FITS format. To view a sample set of test images, or to view the .FITS file format example, please click here to download the sample images.


HOW DO I GET STARTED?
1. Download the User Guide, and learn how to install, launch and upload images into the app
2. Download sample images that you can use within the app for to test how it works.
3. Download an installer to help install the app on your computer. Click here to download the app: http://www.topcoder.com/asteroids/asteroiddatahunter/


WHAT DO I DO IF I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR FIND BUGS?
Please log a ticket using GitHub issue tracking. To log a defect or question, please click here: https://github.com/nasa/NTL-Asteroid-Data-Hunter/issues


OPENSOURCE CODE
The app falls under an Apache license, and is open source – so please feel free to download the source code, tinker and modify the app or algorithm as you see fit.
